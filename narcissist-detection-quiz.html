                        <p>Here's what your answers revealed: <strong>Your partner isn't the narcissist. Your anxiety is making you interpret normal, healthy behavior as threats.</strong></p>

                        <h3>What you're doing:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Catastrophizing when they need sleep, space, or time with friends</li>
                            <li>Interpreting hours without texting as abandonment or cheating</li>
                            <li>Seeing their need for autonomy as rejection</li>
                            <li>Making their normal boundaries about you</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>But here's what you got right:</h3>
                        <p>You CAN spot actual manipulation. When presented with gaslighting, boundary violations, and weaponized guilt, you identified them correctly. This means <strong>you're not in an abusive relationship - you're anxious in a normal one.</strong></p>

                        <h3>How this lands on your partner:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They feel suffocated by your need for constant contact and reassurance</li>
                            <li>They can't have basic autonomy without triggering your panic</li>
                            <li>They feel accused of things they're not doing</li>
                            <li>They're exhausted from managing your anxiety about normal life</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The brutal truth:</h3>
                        <p>You came here looking for validation that they're a narcissist. Your answers show that <strong>you're the one struggling with normal relationship dynamics.</strong> That doesn't make you bad - it makes you anxiously attached and needing help.</p>

                        <h3>What you actually need:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Anxious attachment healing</strong> - Learn to self-soothe instead of seeking constant external validation</li>
                            <li><strong>Individual therapy</strong> - Your partner can't fix your anxiety, and asking them to is unfair</li>
                            <li><strong>Build identity outside the relationship</strong> - Your world is too small if your partner's every move feels like a threat</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>The good news:</strong> You're not being abused. You're just anxious. That's fixable if you're willing to do the work.</p>

                        <p>When your partner:</p>

                            <li>Calls you "too sensitive" → You think you need to calm down</li>
                            <li>Brings up your past mistakes to win arguments → You think you deserve it</li>
                            <li>"Forgets" what matters to you → You think you should remind them more</li>
                            <li>Punishes your boundaries → You think your boundaries are unreasonable</li>
                            <li>Tells you things "never happened" → You doubt your own memory</li>
                            <li>Compares you unfavorably to others → You think you should try harder</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Every single one of these is manipulation. And you're taking the blame for all of it.</strong></p>

                        <h3>Why you can't see it:</h3>
                        <p>You've been systematically trained to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Doubt your perception</li>
                            <li>Take responsibility for their behavior</li>
                            <li>Believe your needs are unreasonable</li>
                            <li>Accept treatment that violates you</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The brutal truth:</h3>
                        <p>You didn't come here anxious and overreacting. You came here already broken down by someone who's been gaslighting you into thinking their abuse is your fault.</p>

                        <h3>What you need to understand:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Gaslighting is real</strong> - They ARE rewriting history, you're not crazy</li>
                            <li><strong>Weaponizing your past is abuse</strong> - You don't owe infinite apologies</li>
                            <li><strong>Punishing boundaries is manipulation</strong> - Your needs aren't unreasonable</li>
                            <li><strong>Invalidation is a tactic</strong> - You're not "too sensitive," you're being dismissed</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>What you actually need:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Learn to recognize manipulation</strong> - What's happening to you has a name</li>
                            <li><strong>Trauma bond work</strong> - You're probably biochemically addicted to this cycle</li>
                            <li><strong>Exit strategy or radical boundary work</strong> - This will not get better without intervention</li>
                            <li><strong>Professional support</strong> - You need help seeing what you've been trained not to see</li>

                        <p>Here's what your answers revealed: <strong>You're anxious AND they're manipulating you. Both things are happening simultaneously.</strong></p>

                        <h3>What YOU'RE bringing:</h3>
                        <h4>Catastrophic interpretation of normal behavior:</h4>
                        <p>When they go to bed early, don't text for hours, or want time with friends, your brain jumps to "they're avoiding me," "they're cheating," "they're hiding me." This is YOUR anxious attachment making neutral actions feel like threats.</p>

                        <h4>Insecurity spirals:</h4>
                        <p>You assume they think your interests are stupid, that they're talking to someone else when busy, that decreased sex means infidelity. These are YOUR stories, not evidence.</p>

                        <h4>Taking blame for their manipulation:</h4>
                        <p>When they call you "too sensitive" or keep bringing up your past mistakes, you think you need to explain better or that you deserve it. You're absorbing responsibility for THEIR tactics.</p>

                        <h3>What THEY'RE actually doing:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Gaslighting you</strong> - Telling you things "never happened" or you're "remembering wrong"</li>
                            <li><strong>Violating your boundaries</strong> - Getting upset or making you feel guilty when you set boundaries</li>
                            <li><strong>Selective "forgetting"</strong> - Remembering what matters to them but forgetting what matters to you</li>
                            <li><strong>Comparative devaluation</strong> - Comparing you unfavorably to others to make you feel inadequate</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The toxic loop you're in:</h3>
                        <p class="arrow">→ They DO harmful things (gaslighting, boundary violations, weaponizing your past)<br>
                        → You correctly identify some of it BUT also take blame for their tactics<br>
                        → Your anxiety makes you hypervigilant about normal things<br>
                        → They use your "overreactions" to dismiss your valid concerns<br>
                        → You can't tell anymore what's real harm vs your anxiety<br>
                        → You're exhausted, confused, and think you're the problem<br>
                        → Repeat</p>

                        <h3>How this lands on THEM:</h3>
                        <p>Your anxious patterns probably make you:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Text repeatedly when they don't respond (feels suffocating)</li>
                            <li>Need constant reassurance (exhausting, they feel responsible for your emotional state)</li>
                            <li>Question normal autonomy (they can't have basic independence without you panicking)</li>
                            <li>Interpret everything through insecurity (they feel constantly accused)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>How their behavior lands on YOU:</h3>
                        <p>Their toxic patterns make you:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Question your own memory and perception (the gaslighting)</li>
                            <li>Unable to set boundaries (they punish you emotionally when you try)</li>
                            <li>Constantly anxious (never sure if concerns are valid or "overreactions")</li>
                            <li>Taking responsibility for their behavior (you think better communication would stop the invalidation)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The brutal truth:</h3>
                        <p><strong>Both things are happening:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>You have anxious attachment that needs work (not because you're bad, but because it's making YOU miserable)</li>
                            <li>They are manipulating you (the gaslighting, boundary violations, weaponizing past are real harm)</li>
                            <li>Your anxiety gives them ammunition (when you overreact to normal stuff, they use it to dismiss VALID concerns)</li>
                            <li>You can't heal your anxiety while being gaslit (almost impossible to regulate while someone rewrites reality)</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>What you actually need:</h3>
                        <p><strong>FIRST: Learn to tell the difference</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Going to bed early, not texting for hours, wanting friend time = NORMAL (your anxiety is the problem)</li>
                            <li>Gaslighting, punishing boundaries, weaponizing past = TOXIC (your concern is valid)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>SECOND: Work on YOUR patterns</strong> (not because you deserve abuse, but because your anxiety is torturing you)</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Anxious attachment healing</li>
                            <li>Learning to self-soothe instead of seeking constant reassurance</li>
                            <li>Building identity outside the relationship</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>THIRD: Decide if you can stay</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Can you set boundaries with someone who punishes boundaries?</li>
                            <li>Can you heal anxiety while being gaslit?</li>
                            <li>Are you willing to do YOUR work while they refuse to do theirs?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The question only you can answer:</h3>
                        <p>Are you willing to work on your anxiety <strong>while also acknowledging they're harming you?</strong></p>
                        <p>Or are you going to keep using "but I'm anxious" to excuse staying with someone who gaslights you?</p>
                        <p><strong>Both your patterns and their abuse are real. The work is yours. The choice to stay or go is also yours.</strong></p>

                        <h3>What your answers revealed:</h3>
                        <p>You think it's a problem when your partner:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Needs sleep instead of talking to you</li>
                            <li>Takes hours to text back while at work or with friends</li>
                            <li>Wants to spend time with other people</li>
                            <li>Doesn't post about you on social media</li>
                            <li>Mentions an ex in neutral conversation</li>
                            <li>Has interests you don't share</li>
                            <li>Disagrees with you about something</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>None of these things are problems. These are normal, healthy boundaries.</strong></p>

                        <h3>But you also correctly identified manipulation:</h3>
                        <p>When presented with gaslighting, boundary violations, and weaponizing past mistakes, you knew exactly what those were. Which means <strong>you're not confused about what abuse looks like - you just can't handle normal relationship dynamics.</strong></p>

                        <h3>How this is landing on your partner:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They can't have basic autonomy without you panicking</li>
                            <li>They feel responsible for your constant emotional crises</li>
                            <li>They're being accused of cheating/avoiding you for living their life</li>
                            <li>They feel suffocated by your need for constant contact and validation</li>
                            <li>They can't disagree with you without you taking it as rejection</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The brutal truth:</h3>
                        <p><strong>Your partner isn't a narcissist. You're anxiously attached to the point where you're controlling, overwhelming, and making their normal needs about you.</strong></p>

                        <p>That doesn't make you evil. But it does make you the problem in this dynamic.</p>

                        <h3>What you need to hear:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your partner going to bed early is not abandonment</li>
                            <li>Not texting for hours while at work is not avoidance</li>
                            <li>Wanting time with friends is not choosing them over you</li>
                            <li>Not posting on social media is not hiding you</li>
                            <li>Having their own interests is not thinking yours are stupid</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>These are normal human needs, and you're treating them like betrayals.</strong></p>

                        <h3>What you actually need:</h3>
                        <ul>

                            <li><strong>Build a life outside this relationship</strong> - Your world is dangerously small</li>
                            <li><strong>Learn to self-soothe</strong> - Your partner can't fix your anxiety</li>
                            <li><strong>Consider if YOU should be in a relationship right now</strong> - You might need to work on yourself before you're ready for partnership</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The good news: <strong>This is fixable if you're willing to own it.</strong> But first you have to stop blaming your partner for having normal boundaries.</p>

                        <p><strong>Their tactics fuel your anxiety:</strong> Their gaslighting makes you doubt your perception. Their boundary violations make you more vigilant. Their punishment of your needs makes you more desperate for validation.</p>

                            <li>When they rewrite history → You doubt your own memory</li>
                            <li>When they compare you unfavorably → You think you should work harder to be good enough</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>These aren't "relationship problems." This is systematic abuse, and you've been trained to blame yourself for all of it.</strong></p>

                        <h3>But you also didn't show anxious patterns:</h3>
                        <p>You weren't catastrophizing about them going to bed early, not texting for hours, or spending time with friends. You didn't interpret normal behavior as threats.</p>

                        <p><strong>This means you're not an anxious person making mountains out of molehills. You're a person whose reality has been systematically dismantled.</strong></p>

                        <h3>What's been done to you:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Gaslighting</strong> - They've convinced you that your memory is faulty and your perception is wrong</li>
                            <li><strong>Invalidation</strong> - They've trained you to believe your feelings are overreactions</li>
                            <li><strong>Boundary destruction</strong> - They've made you feel guilty for having any needs</li>
                            <li><strong>Weaponized guilt</strong> - They keep you paying forever for past mistakes</li>
                            <li><strong>Devaluation</strong> - They compare you to others to keep you feeling inadequate</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Why you can't see it:</h3>
                        <p>You've been trained to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Doubt your own perception (gaslighting works)</li>
                            <li>Take responsibility for their behavior (you think better communication would fix it)</li>
                            <li>Believe your needs are unreasonable (you've been punished for having them)</li>
                            <li>Accept treatment that violates your boundaries (you think you're asking too much)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Your "boundary deficits" aren't character flaws. They're the result of being systematically trained to have no boundaries.</strong></p>

                        <h3>The brutal truth:</h3>
                        <p>You're not in a difficult relationship. You're not just anxious. <strong>You're being abused, and you've been gaslit into thinking you're the problem.</strong></p>

                        <h3>What you need to understand:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You're not "too sensitive" - you're being dismissed</li>
                            <li>You don't owe infinite apologies - they're weaponizing your guilt</li>
                            <li>Your boundaries aren't unreasonable - they're being violated</li>
                            <li>Your memory isn't faulty - it's being rewritten</li>
                            <li>You're not inadequate - you're being devalued</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>None of this is your fault. But staying is your choice.</strong></p>

                        <h3>What you actually need:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Safety assessment</strong> - Is it safe for you to leave? Do you need help?</li>
                            <li><strong>Support system activation</strong> - Tell people outside this relationship what's happening</li>
                            <li><strong>Professional help</strong> - Trauma-informed therapy with someone who understands abuse</li>
                            <li><strong>Exit strategy</strong> - Even if you're not ready to leave, know what leaving would look like</li>
                            <li><strong>Reality anchoring</strong> - Document things, talk to people who can reflect reality back to you</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>You deserve better than this. You didn't cause this. You can't fix this by being better.</strong></p>

                        <p>Your answers revealed something unusual for this quiz: <strong>You're actually pretty secure in relationships.</strong></p>

                        <h3>What your answers showed:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You don't catastrophize when your partner needs sleep, space, or time with friends</li>
                            <li>You recognize normal autonomy as healthy, not threatening</li>
                            <li>You can spot actual manipulation (gaslighting, boundary violations, weaponizing past)</li>
                            <li>You don't take inappropriate responsibility for their behavior</li>
                            <li>You give people space to process without making it about you</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Two possibilities:</h3>
                        <p><strong>Possibility 1: You're in a healthy relationship</strong><br>
                        Your partner has normal boundaries, you respect them, and you both handle conflict without manipulation. If this is true, you don't need this quiz - you're doing fine.</p>

                        <p><strong>Possibility 2: You've done significant healing work</strong><br>
                        You used to be anxious or struggled with boundaries, but you've worked on yourself and developed security. You might still have moments of insecurity, but overall you're operating from a healthy place.</p>

                        <h3>Why you might have taken this quiz:</h3>
                        <p>If you're this secure, you probably took this quiz because:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Someone accused YOU of being the narcissist and you're checking</li>
                            <li>You're worried about a friend's relationship and wanted perspective</li>
                            <li>You're just curious about relationship dynamics</li>
                            <li>You wanted confirmation that you're not crazy for having boundaries</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>If you're still concerned:</h3>
                        <p>Secure people can still have anxious moments. Having occasional insecurity doesn't negate your overall health. The difference is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Anxious attachment:</strong> Constantly catastrophizing, making everything about you, unable to give space</li>
                            <li><strong>Secure with moments of anxiety:</strong> Occasional worry that you can reality-check and self-soothe</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>You're showing the second pattern, not the first.</p>

                        <h3>What you might need (if anything):</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Continue whatever healing work got you here</li>
                            <li>Use your secure attachment to help others see what healthy looks like</li>
                            <li>Stay vigilant about recognizing manipulation if it shows up</li>
                            <li>Trust your ability to spot red flags - you clearly can</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>The bottom line: You're doing well. Keep doing what you're doing.</strong></p>
